Cellular Automata library module for Ruby

See COPYING for licensing information.

This module is intended to aid the creation of cellular automata.  To create a new c.a., it is easiest to create a definition file.  These files are organised as follows;


Automaton.create :Prototype do
	# States
	state :INIT, :color => [0,0,0]
	state :STATE1, :color => [255,0,0]

	## Grids
	grid :FIELD1, :width => 32, :height => 32
	grid :FIELD2, :width => 32, :height => 32

	## Transitions
	transition "FIELD1:INIT", "INIT+3 -> STATE1" 
end

Then, you create your automata with
myca = CellularAutomata::Automaton.load('file.rb')

Now you have access to myca.grids[], states[], and transitions[]
